Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

While the project is free to use under the MIT licence, if you'd like to file an issue to receive support about a bug you found, a feature you'd like or if you just have a question, you'll need to be a Bronze sponsor or higher on Patreon to do this: https://www.patreon.com/mattlewis92

Any issues opened here will be automatically closed and locked. Thanks for using this project! âœŒ
